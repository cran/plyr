plyr 0.1.8 (2008-04-20) ---------------------------------------------------

* made rbind a little faster (~20%) using an idea from Richard Raubertas
* daply now works correctly when splitting variables that contain empty factor levels

plyr 0.1.7 (2008-04-15) ---------------------------------------------------

Ensure that rbind.fill copies attributes.

plyr 0.1.6 (2008-04-15) ---------------------------------------------------

Improvements:

* all ply functions deal more elegantly when given function names: can supply a vector of function names, and name is used as label in output
* failwith and each now work with function names as well as functions (i.e. "nrow" instead of nrow)
* each now accepts a list of functions or a vector of function names
* l*ply will use list names where present
* if .inform is TRUE, error messages will give you information about where errors within your data - hopefully this will make problems easier to track down

Speed-ups

* massive speed ups for splitting large arrays
* fixed typo that was causing a 50% speed penalty for d*ply
* rewritten rbind.fill is considerably (> 4x) faster for many data frames
* colwise about twice as fast

Bug fixes:

* daply: now works when the data frame is split by multiple variables
* aaply: now works with vectors
* ddply: first variable now varies slowest as you'd expect


plyr 0.1.5 (2008-02-23) ---------------------------------------------------

* colwise now accepts a quoted list as its second argument.  This allows you to specify the names of columns to work on: colwise(mean, .(lat, long))
* d_ply and a_ply now correctly pass ... to the function

plyr 0.1.4 (2008-12-12) ---------------------------------------------------

 * Greatly improved speed (> 10x faster) and memory usage (50%) for splitting data frames with many combinations
 * Splitting variables containing missing values now handled consistently

plyr 0.1.3 (2008-11-19) ---------------------------------------------------

Fixed problem where when splitting by a variable that contained missing values, missing combinations would be drop, and labels wouldn't match up

plyr 0.1.2 (2008-11-18) ---------------------------------------------------

  * a*ply now works correctly with array-lists
  * drop. -> .drop
  * r*ply now works with ...
  * use inherits instead of is so method package doesn't need to be loaded
  * fix bug with using formulas

plyr 0.1.1 (2008-10-08) ---------------------------------------------------

  * argument names now start with . (instead of ending with it) - this should prevent name clashes with arguments of the called function 
  * return informative error if .fun is not a function
  * use full names in all internal calls to avoid argument name clashes
