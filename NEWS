plyr 1.0 (2010-07-02) ---------------------------------------------------

New functions:

* arrange, a new helper method for reordering a data frame.
* count, a version of table that returns data frames immediately and that is
  much much faster for high-dimensional data.
* desc makes it easy to sort any vector in descending order
* join, works like merge but can be much faster and has a somewhat simpler
  syntax drawing from SQL terminology
* rbind.fill.matrix is like rbind.fill but works for matrices, code 
  contributed by C. Beleites

Speed improvements

* experimental immutable data frame (idata.frame) that vastly speeds up
  subsetting - for large datasets with large numbers of groups, this can yield
  10-fold speed ups. See examples in ?idata.frame to see how to use it.
* rbind.fill rewritten again to increase speed and work with more data types
* d*ply now much faster with nested groups

New features:

* d*ply now accepts NULL for splitting variables, indicating that the data
  should not be split
* plyr no longer exports internal functions, many of which were causing
  clashes with other packages
* rbind.fill now works with data frame columns that are lists or matrices
* test suite ensures that plyr behaviour is correct and will remain correct
  as I make future improvements.

Bug fixes:

* **ply: if zero splits, empty list(), data.frame() or logical() returned, 
  as appropriate for the output type
* **ply: leaving .fun as NULL now always returns list 
  (thanks to Stavros Macrakis for the bug report)
* a*ply: labels now respect options(stringAsFactors)
* each: scoping bug fixed, thanks to Yasuhisa Yoshida for the bug report
* list_to_dataframe is more consistent when processing a single data frame
* NAs preserved in more places
* progress bars: guaranteed to terminate even if **ply prematurely terminates
* progress bars: misspelling gives informative warning, instead of
  uninformative error
* splitter_d: fixed ordering bug when .drop = FALSE

plyr 0.1.9 (2009-06-23) ---------------------------------------------------

* fix bug in rbind.fill when NULLs present in list
* improve each to recognise when all elements are numeric
* fix labelling bug in d*ply when .drop = FALSE
* additional methods for quoted objects
* add summarise helper - this function is like transform, but creates a new data frame rather than reusing the old (thanks to Brendan O'Connor for the neat idea)

plyr 0.1.8 (2009-04-20) ---------------------------------------------------

* made rbind a little faster (~20%) using an idea from Richard Raubertas
* daply now works correctly when splitting variables that contain empty factor levels

plyr 0.1.7 (2009-04-15) ---------------------------------------------------

Ensure that rbind.fill copies attributes.

plyr 0.1.6 (2009-04-15) ---------------------------------------------------

Improvements:

* all ply functions deal more elegantly when given function names: can supply a vector of function names, and name is used as label in output
* failwith and each now work with function names as well as functions (i.e. "nrow" instead of nrow)
* each now accepts a list of functions or a vector of function names
* l*ply will use list names where present
* if .inform is TRUE, error messages will give you information about where errors within your data - hopefully this will make problems easier to track down
* d*ply no longer converts splitting variables to factors when drop = T (thanks to bug report from Charlotte Wickham)

Speed-ups

* massive speed ups for splitting large arrays
* fixed typo that was causing a 50% speed penalty for d*ply
* rewritten rbind.fill is considerably (> 4x) faster for many data frames
* colwise about twice as fast

Bug fixes:

* daply: now works when the data frame is split by multiple variables
* aaply: now works with vectors
* ddply: first variable now varies slowest as you'd expect


plyr 0.1.5 (2009-02-23) ---------------------------------------------------

* colwise now accepts a quoted list as its second argument.  This allows you to specify the names of columns to work on: colwise(mean, .(lat, long))
* d_ply and a_ply now correctly pass ... to the function

plyr 0.1.4 (2008-12-12) ---------------------------------------------------

 * Greatly improved speed (> 10x faster) and memory usage (50%) for splitting data frames with many combinations
 * Splitting variables containing missing values now handled consistently

plyr 0.1.3 (2008-11-19) ---------------------------------------------------

Fixed problem where when splitting by a variable that contained missing values, missing combinations would be drop, and labels wouldn't match up

plyr 0.1.2 (2008-11-18) ---------------------------------------------------

  * a*ply now works correctly with array-lists
  * drop. -> .drop
  * r*ply now works with ...
  * use inherits instead of is so method package doesn't need to be loaded
  * fix bug with using formulas

plyr 0.1.1 (2008-10-08) ---------------------------------------------------

  * argument names now start with . (instead of ending with it) - this should prevent name clashes with arguments of the called function 
  * return informative error if .fun is not a function
  * use full names in all internal calls to avoid argument name clashes
